        <h3>Location: Rajasthan </h3>
        <div class="des">
        <p>Description:Rajasthan's royal legacy is apparent in its wealth of colossal palaces and desert forts. Competition is steep, but few of its landmarks are more impressive to behold than the Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur. Among the largest such fortifications in India, its clifftop location more than 100 metres above the Blue City makes it impossible to miss. </p>

        <h3>Location: Delhi </h3>
        <div class="des">
        <p>Description: Though it’s the final resting place of the Mughal Emperor Humayun, this tomb has the scope and splendour of a palace. Among the first ‘garden-tombs’ in India, the Delhi-based landmark is a beautiful example of Persian architecture, and is surrounded by a lovely garden and water features. Come for the history and stay for the oasis-like setting. </p>

        <div class="des">
        <p>Description:The Taj Mahal isn’t just one of the most incredible landmarks in India—it’s a bona fide Wonder of the World, and a bucket-list destination for millions.
